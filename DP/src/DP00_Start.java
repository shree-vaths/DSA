	 * Tabulation is bottom up - We start building from bottom
	 * Memoization is top down - We go down and then start building from the bottom
	 * Memoization is storing results of sub problems
	 * Memoization only works if you are going to 0 from n and then while coming back from 0 to n we keep on storing it.
	 * Or going to n from 0 and then coming back to 0 as well.
	 * If you are going to 0 to n or n to 0 and finalize the result then memoization is of no use, there will be no repetation.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Count total no of ways to do things
	 * find min or maximum values among many ways
	 * find best way to do things
	 * 
	 * First find if its recursion and then go for DP
	 * Try to represent using index
	 * 
	 * Greedy only works when values are differ by same interval like 10,20,30 but not for 10,30,70,120
	 * If there are many ways in the next step go for recursion
	 * 
	 * Always write out of bound base cases then go for destination bound cases
