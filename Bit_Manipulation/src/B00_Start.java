	 * 
	 * For OR, if there is atleast 1 then answer is 1
	 * For XOR, if 1s are multiples of 2 then its 0
	 * XOR of two same no is 0
	 * 
	 * Left shift is multiplication by 2
	 * Right shift is division by 2
	 * 
	 * The negative no is stored as 2s compliment of their positive no. And first bit automatically becomes 1.
	 * This first bit is 1 which represents negative.
	 * 
	 * Whenever we do left shift on Int_MAX, the no goes out of boundary which gives junk value.
	 * This is called overflow.
