	 * With substring and subarray first try with two pointer
	 * With subsequence and subset is for recursion
	 * 
	 * Sliding Window Assumptions:
The sliding window technique relies on the property that adding elements to the window increases the sum, and removing elements decreases it.
This allows you to expand the window when the sum is less than the target and shrink it when the sum is greater.
Negative Numbers Break the Assumption:
With negative numbers, adding an element might decrease the sum, and removing an element might increase it.
This means you can't reliably determine whether to expand or shrink the window based solely on the current sum.

	* Longest subarray with sum k where all items are positive can be solved using two pointers
